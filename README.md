# Resume Select UI

Based on the fantastic [jsonresume](https://jsonresume.org) toolchain, resume-select-ui let's you select a subset of your skills and experience for a particular job/project. You can also filter your qualification by the skills requested in the job/project posting and then customize to your needs. Finally you can adapt your summary.

Your original resume is never touched. If you want something to edit you full resume, try [jsonresume editor](http://registry.jsonresume.org/). resume-select-ui automatically updates your customized resume in the background and displays the result immediately. You'll need an up to date Chrome to use it or drop some polyfills in the index.html for web component stuff.

```sh
npm install resume-select-ui
cd resume-select-ui
npm start
```
then open `http://localhost:8080` in your Chrome.

Hope you find this useful.
